## Description:
This repository contains our training, testing, and analysis code for 3 ML models to predict and improve our bot's grid-traversal performance.

## Project Structure:
- *Bot1.ipynb* contains our setup code for the bot
- *Model1.ipynb* contains the dataset generation code, model training, testing, and analysis for Model 1
- *Model2.ipynb* contains the dataset generation code, model training, testing, and analysis for Model 2
- *Model3.ipynb* contains the dataset generation code, model training, testing, and analysis for Model 3
- *Model1-Bonus.ipynb* contains the dataset generation code, model training, testing, and analysis for the Bonus Model 1
- *Model2-Bonus.ipynb* contains the dataset generation code, model training, testing, and analysis for the Bonus Model 2
